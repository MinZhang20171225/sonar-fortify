Fortify SCA Plugin for SonarQube
================================

> The plugin is deprecated, it is indeed not possible to support it without support from HP.
> You might want to take a look at the [SonarQube plugin for ThreadFix](https://github.com/denimgroup/threadfix) - which is supposed to support Fortify.

Documentation of this deprecated plugin is still available at http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/PLUG/Fortify+Plugin.
