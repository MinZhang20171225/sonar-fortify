    <name>Insecure Transport: Weak SSL Protocol</name>
    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  SSLv2 protocol contains several flaws that make it insecure and should be avoided to transmit sensitive data.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol provide a protection mechanism to ensure authenticity, confidentiality and integrity of the data transmitted between a client and web server.<br>The TLS/SSL protocol has undergone various revisions resulting in periodic version updates. Each new revision was designed to address the security weaknesses discovered in the previous versions. Use of insecure protocol versions will weaken the strength of the transport protection and could allow an attacker to compromise, steal or modify sensitive information.<br><br>Weak TLS/SSL protocols may exhibit any or all of the following properties:<br><br>- No protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.<br>- Same key used for authentication and encryption.<br>- Weak message authentication control.<br>- No protection against TCP connection closing.<br><br>These properties can allow an attacker to intercept, modify and tamper with sensitive data.<br>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The mask specified by the argument <code>umask()</code> is often confused with the argument to <code>chmod()</code>.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  The <code>umask()</code> man page begins with the false statement:<br><br>"umask sets the umask to mask &amp; 0777"<br><br>Although this behavior would better align with the usage of <code>chmod()</code>, where the user provided argument specifies the bits to enable on the specified file, the behavior of <code>umask()</code> is in fact opposite: <code>umask()</code> sets the umask to <code>~mask &amp; 0777</code>.<br><br>The <code>umask()</code> man page goes on to describe the correct usage of <code>umask()</code>:<br><br>"The umask is used to set initial file permissions on a newly-created file. Specifically, permissions in the umask are turned off from the mode argument (so, for example, the common umask default value of 022 results in new files being created with permissions 0666 &amp; ~022 = 0644 = rw-r--r-- in the usual case where the mode is specified as 0666)."

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Failure to adhere to the principle of least privilege amplifies the risk posed by other vulnerabilities.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Programs that run with <code>root</code> privileges have caused innumerable Unix security disasters. It is imperative that you carefully review privileged programs for all kinds of security problems, but it is equally important that privileged programs drop back to an unprivileged state as quickly as possible in order to limit the amount of damage that an overlooked vulnerability might be able to cause.<br><br><br>Privilege management functions can behave in some less-than-obvious ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-<code>root</code> user to another.<br><br>Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if a process is running as <code>root</code> when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges. An attacker may be able to leverage these elevated privileges to do further damage.

							<p>
							  The call either does not verify the hostname of the SSL server certificate or allows self-signed certificates to be used in HTTPS protocol negotiations.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  During development developers build their applications with test or self-signed SSL certificates.  This allows the developers to test HTTPS functionality without going through the processes of formally requesting and attesting to a SSL certificate.  However, many times the code which allows the use of self-signed certificates is left in allowing for HTTPS based Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following code allows any HTTPS certificate for all HTTPS connections:<br><br><pre><br>ssl_sock = ssl.wrap_socket(s)<br></pre>

							<p>
							  The use of hardcoded file separators causes portability problems.

							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Different operating systems use different characters as file separators. For example, Microsoft Windows systems use "\", while UNIX systems use "/". When applications have to run on different platforms, the use of hardcoded file separators can lead to incorrect execution of application logic and potentially a denial of service.<br><br><br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following code uses a hardcoded file separator to open a file:<br><br><pre><br>...<br>os.open(directoryName + "\\" + fileName);<br>...<br></pre>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The program defines an overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Prior to HTML5, Web browsers enforced the Same Origin Policy which ensures that in order for JavaScript to access the contents of a Web page, both the JavaScript and the Web page must originate from the same domain. Without the Same Origin Policy, a malicious website could serve up JavaScript that loads sensitive information from other websites using a client's credentials, culls through it, and communicates it back to the attacker. HTML5 makes it possible for JavaScript to access data across domains if a new HTTP header called <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> is defined. With this header, a Web server defines which other domains are allowed to access its domain using cross-origin requests. However, caution should be taken when defining the header because an overly permissive CORS policy will allow a malicious application to communicate with the victim application in an inappropriate way, leading to spoofing, data theft, relay and other attacks.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> Below is an example of using a wildcard to programmatically specify which domains the application is allowed to communicate with.<br><br><pre><br>  response.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")<br></pre><br><br>Using the <code>*</code> as the value of the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header indicates that the application's data is accessible to JavaScript running on any domain.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Using standard output or standard error rather than a dedicated logging facility makes it difficult to monitor the behavior of the program.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  <b>Example 1:</b> The first Python program that a developer learns to write often looks like this:<br><br><pre><br>print("hello world")<br></pre><br><br>While most programmers go on to learn many nuances and subtleties about Python, a surprising number hang on to this first lesson and never give up on writing messages to standard output using <code>print()</code> or <code>sys.stdout.write()</code>.<br><br>The problem is that writing directly to standard output or standard error is often used as an unstructured form of logging. Structured logging facilities provide features like logging levels, uniform formatting, a logger identifier, timestamps, and, perhaps most critically, the ability to direct the log messages to the right place. When the use of system output streams is jumbled together with the code that uses loggers properly, the result is often a well-kept log that is missing critical information.<br><br>Developers widely accept the need for structured logging, but many continue to use system output streams in their "pre-production" development. If the code you are reviewing is past the initial phases of development, use of <code>sys.stdout</code> or <code>sys.stderr</code> may indicate an oversight in the move to a structured logging system.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Mishandling private information, such as customer passwords or social security numbers, can compromise user privacy and is often illegal. 
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Privacy violations occur when:<br><br>1. Private user information enters the program.<br><br>2. The data is written to an external location, such as the console, file system, or network.<br><br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code contains a logging statement that tracks the contents of records added to a database by storing them in a log file. Among other values that are stored is the return value from the <code>getPassword()</code> function that returns user-supplied plaintext password associated with the account.<br><br><pre><br>pass = getPassword();<br>logger.warning('%s: %s %s %s', id, pass, type, tsstamp)<br></pre><br><br>The code in the example above logs a plaintext password to the application eventlog. Although many developers trust the eventlog as a safe storage location for data, it should not be trusted implicitly, particularly when privacy is a concern.<br><br>Private data can enter a program in a variety of ways:<br><br>- Directly from the user in the form of a password or personal information<br><br>- Accessed from a database or other data store by the application<br><br>- Indirectly from a partner or other third party<br><br>Sometimes data that is not labeled as private can have a privacy implication in a different context. For example, student identification numbers are usually not considered private because there is no explicit and publicly-available mapping to an individual student's personal information. However, if a school generates identification numbers based on student social security numbers, then the identification numbers should be considered private.<br><br>Security and privacy concerns often seem to compete with each other. From a security perspective, you should record all important operations so that any anomalous activity can later be identified. However, when private data is involved, this practice can create risk.<br><br>Although there are many ways in which private data can be handled unsafely, a common risk stems from misplaced trust. Programmers often trust the operating environment in which a program runs, and therefore believe that it is acceptable to store private information on the file system, in the registry, or in other locally-controlled resources. However, even if access to certain resources is restricted, this does not guarantee that the individuals who do have access can be trusted. For example, in 2004, an unscrupulous employee at AOL sold approximately 92 million private customer e-mail addresses to a spammer marketing an offshore gambling web site [1].<br><br>In response to such high-profile exploits, the collection and management of private data is becoming increasingly regulated. Depending on its location, the type of business it conducts, and the nature of any private data it handles, an organization may be required to comply with one or more of the following federal and state regulations:<br><br>- Safe Harbor Privacy Framework [3]<br><br>- Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (GLBA) [4]<br><br>- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) [5]<br><br>- California SB-1386 [6]<br><br>Despite these regulations, privacy violations continue to occur with alarming frequency.

							<p>
							  Revealing system data or debugging information helps an adversary learn about the system and form a plan of attack.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  An external information leak occurs when system data or debugging information leaves the program to a remote machine via a socket or network connection.<br><br><br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code prints an exception to the HTTP response:<br><br><pre><br>...<br>return render_to_response(template_name, {'error': sys.exc_info() })<br>...<br></pre><br><br>Depending upon the system configuration, this information can be dumped to a console, written to a log file, or exposed to a remote user. For example, with scripting mechanisms it is trivial to redirect output information from &quot;Standard error&quot; or &quot;Standard output&quot; into a file or another program. Alternatively the system that the program runs on could have a remote logging mechanism such as a &quot;syslog&quot; server that will send the logs to a remote device. During development you will have no way of knowing where this information may end up being displayed. <br><br>In some cases the error message tells the attacker precisely what sort of an attack the system is vulnerable to. For example, a database error message can reveal that the application is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. Other error messages can reveal more oblique clues about the system. In the example above, the leaked information could imply information about the type of operating system, the applications installed on the system, and the amount of care that the administrators have put into configuring the program.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Commingling trusted and untrusted data in the same data structure encourages programmers to mistakenly trust unvalidated data.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  A trust boundary can be thought of as line drawn through a program. On one side of the line, data is untrusted. On the other side of the line, data is assumed to be trustworthy. The purpose of validation logic is to allow data to safely cross the trust boundary--to move from untrusted to trusted.<br><br>A trust boundary violation occurs when a program blurs the line between what is trusted and what is untrusted. The most common way to make this mistake is to allow trusted and untrusted data to commingle in the same data structure.<br><br><br><br><b>Example:</b> The following Python code accepts an HTTP request and stores the <code>username</code> parameter in the HTTP session object before checking to ensure that the user has been authenticated.<br><br><pre><br>uname = request.GET['username']<br>request.session['username'] = uname<br></pre><br><br>Without well-established and maintained trust boundaries, programmers will inevitably lose track of which pieces of data have been validated and which have not. This confusion will eventually allow some data to be used without first being validated.

							<p>
							  Ignoring an exception can cause the program to overlook unexpected states and conditions.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Just about every serious attack on a software system begins with the violation of a programmer's assumptions. After the attack, the programmer's assumptions seem flimsy and poorly founded, but before an attack many programmers would defend their assumptions well past the end of their lunch break.<br><br>Two dubious assumptions that are easy to spot in code are "this method call can never fail" and "it doesn't matter if this call fails". When a programmer ignores an exception, they implicitly state that they are operating under one of these assumptions.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following code excerpt ignores a rarely-thrown exception from <code>open()</code>.<br><br><pre><br>try:<br>    f = open('myfile.txt')<br>    s = f.readline()<br>    i = int(s.strip())<br>except:<br>   # This will never happen<br>   pass<br></pre><br><br>If a <code>RareException</code> were to ever be thrown, the program would continue to execute as though nothing unusual had occurred. The program records no evidence indicating the special situation, potentially frustrating any later attempt to explain the program's behavior.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Executing commands from an untrusted source or in an untrusted environment can cause an application to execute malicious commands on behalf of an attacker.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Command injection vulnerabilities take two forms:<br><br>- An attacker can change the command that the program executes: the attacker explicitly controls what the command is.<br><br>- An attacker can change the environment in which the command executes: the attacker implicitly controls what the command means.<br><br>In this case we are primarily concerned with the first scenario, the possibility that an attacker may be able to control the command that is executed. Command injection vulnerabilities of this type occur when:<br><br>1. Data enters the application from an untrusted source.<br><br><IfDef var="ConditionalDescriptions"><br> <br></IfDef><br><br>2. The data is used as or as part of a string representing a command that is executed by the application.<br><br>3. By executing the command, the application gives an attacker a privilege or capability that the attacker would not otherwise have.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following code from a system utility uses the system property <code>APPHOME</code> to determine the directory in which it is installed and then executes an initialization script based on a relative path from the specified directory.<br><br><pre><br>	...<br>	home = os.getenv('APPHOME')<br>	cmd = home.join(INITCMD)<br>	os.system(cmd);<br>	...<br></pre><br><br>The code in Example 1 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the elevated privilege of the application by modifying the system property <code>APPHOME</code> to point to a different path containing a malicious version of <code>INITCMD</code>. Because the program does not validate the value read from the environment, if an attacker can control the value of the system property <code>APPHOME</code>, then they can fool the application into running malicious code and take control of the system.<br><br><b>Example 2:</b> The following code is from an administrative web application designed to allow users to kick off a backup of an Oracle database using a batch-file wrapper around the <code>rman</code> utility and then run a <code>cleanup.bat</code> script to delete some temporary files. The script <code>rmanDB.bat</code> accepts a single command line parameter, which specifies the type of backup to perform. Because access to the database is restricted, the application runs the backup as a privileged user.<br><br><pre><br>...<br>	btype = req.field('backuptype')<br>	cmd = "cmd.exe /K \"c:\\util\\rmanDB.bat " + btype + "&amp;&amp;c:\\util\\cleanup.bat\""<br>	os.system(cmd);<br>...<br></pre><br><br>The problem here is that the program does not do any validation on the <code>backuptype</code> parameter read from the user. Typically the <code>Runtime.exec()</code> function will not execute multiple commands, but in this case the program first runs the <code>cmd.exe</code> shell in order to run multiple commands with a single call to <code>Runtime.exec()</code>. Once the shell is invoked, it will allow for the execution of multiple commands separated by two ampersands. If an attacker passes a string of the form <code>"&amp;&amp; del c:\\dbms\\*.*"</code>, then the application will execute this command along with the others specified by the program. Because of the nature of the application, it runs with the privileges necessary to interact with the database, which means whatever command the attacker injects will run with those privileges as well.<br><br><b>Example 3:</b> The following code is from a web application that allows users access to an interface through which they can update their password on the system. Part of the process for updating passwords in certain network environments is to run a <code>make</code> command in the <code>/var/yp</code> directory, the code for which is shown below.<br><br><pre><br>...<br>result = os.system("make");<br>...<br></pre><br><br>The problem here is that the program does not specify an absolute path for make and fails to clean its environment prior to executing the call to <code>os.system()</code>. If an attacker can modify the <code>$PATH</code> variable to point to a malicious binary called <code>make</code> and cause the program to be executed in their environment, then the malicious binary will be loaded instead of the one intended. Because of the nature of the application, it runs with the privileges necessary to perform system operations, which means the attacker's <code>make</code> will now be run with these privileges, possibly giving the attacker complete control of the system.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Sending unvalidated data to a web browser can result in the browser executing malicious code.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:<br><br>1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source. In the case of Persistent (also known as Stored) XSS, the untrusted source is typically a database or other back-end datastore, while in the case of Reflected XSS it is typically a web request.<br><br><br>2. The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated.<br><br>The malicious content sent to the web browser often takes the form of a segment of JavaScript, but may also include HTML, Flash or any other type of code that the browser may execute. The variety of attacks based on XSS is almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting private data like cookies or other session information to the attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following Python code segment reads an employee ID, <code>eid</code>, from an HTTP request and displays it to the user.<br><br><pre><br>	req = self.request()  # fetch the request object<br>        eid = req.field('eid',None) # tainted request message<br>	...<br>	self.writeln("Employee ID:" + eid)<br></pre><br><br>The code in this example operates correctly if <code>eid</code> contains only standard alphanumeric text. If <code>eid</code> has a value that includes meta-characters or source code, then the code will be executed by the web browser as it displays the HTTP response.<br><br>Initially this might not appear to be much of a vulnerability. After all, why would someone enter a URL that causes malicious code to run on their own computer? The real danger is that an attacker will create the malicious URL, then use e-mail or social engineering tricks to lure victims into visiting a link to the URL. When victims click the link, they unwittingly reflect the malicious content through the vulnerable web application back to their own computers. This mechanism of exploiting vulnerable web applications is known as Reflected XSS.<br><br><b>Example 2:</b> The following Python code segment queries a database for an employee with a given ID and prints the corresponding employee's name.<br><br><pre><br> ...<br> cursor.execute("select * from emp where id="+eid)<br> row = cursor.fetchone()<br> self.writeln('Employee name: ' + row["emp"]')<br> ...<br></pre><br><br>As in Example 1, this code functions correctly when the values of <code>name</code> are well-behaved, but it does nothing to prevent exploits if they are not. Again, this code can appear less dangerous because the value of <code>name</code> is read from a database, whose contents are apparently managed by the application. However, if the value of <code>name</code> originates from user-supplied data, then the database can be a conduit for malicious content. Without proper input validation on all data stored in the database, an attacker can execute malicious commands in the user's web browser. This type of exploit, known as Persistent (or Stored) XSS, is particularly insidious because the indirection caused by the data store makes it more difficult to identify the threat and increases the possibility that the attack will affect multiple users. XSS got its start in this form with web sites that offered a "guestbook" to visitors. Attackers would include JavaScript in their guestbook entries, and all subsequent visitors to the guestbook page would execute the malicious code.<br><br>As the examples demonstrate, XSS vulnerabilities are caused by code that includes unvalidated data in an HTTP response. There are three vectors by which an XSS attack can reach a victim:<br><br>- As in Example 1, data is read directly from the HTTP request and reflected back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a user to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the user and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to victims. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces victims to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the user, the content is executed and proceeds to transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the user's machine to the attacker or perform other nefarious activities.<br><br>- As in Example 2, the application stores dangerous data in a database or other trusted data store. The dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. Persistent XSS exploits occur when an attacker injects dangerous content into a data store that is later read and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user.<br><br>- A source outside the application stores dangerous data in a database or other data store, and the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application as trusted data and included in dynamic content.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Relying on HTML, XML and other types of encoding to validate user input can result in the browser executing malicious code.>
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  The use of certain encoding functions will prevent some, but not all cross-site scripting attacks. Depending on the context in which the data appear, characters beyond the basic &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, and " that are HTML-encoded and those beyond &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, ", and ' that are XML-encoded may take on meta-meaning. Relying on such encoding functions is equivalent to using a weak blacklist to prevent cross-site scripting and might allow an attacker to inject malicious code that will be executed in the browser. Because accurately identifying the context in which the data appear statically is not always possible, the HP Fortify Secure Coding Rulepacks report cross-site scripting findings even when encoding is applied and presents them as Cross-Site Scripting: Poor Validation issues.<br><br>Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:<br><br>1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source. In the case of Reflected XSS, the untrusted source is typically a web request, while in the case of Persisted (also known as Stored) XSS it is typically a database or other back-end datastore.<br><br><br>2. The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated.<br><br>The malicious content sent to the web browser often takes the form of a segment of JavaScript, but may also include HTML, Flash or any other type of code that the browser may execute. The variety of attacks based on XSS is almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting private data like cookies or other session information to the attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following Python code segment reads an employee ID, <code>eid</code>, from an HTTP request, HTML-encodes it, and displays it to the user.<br><br><pre><br>        req = self.request()  # fetch the request object<br>        eid = req.field('eid',None) # tainted request message<br>        ...<br>        self.writeln("Employee ID:" + escape(eid))<br></pre><br><br>The code in this example operates correctly if <code>eid</code> contains only standard alphanumeric text. If <code>eid</code> has a value that includes meta-characters or source code, then the code will be executed by the web browser as it displays the HTTP response.<br><br>Initially this might not appear to be much of a vulnerability. After all, why would someone enter a URL that causes malicious code to run on their own computer? The real danger is that an attacker will create the malicious URL, then use e-mail or social engineering tricks to lure victims into visiting a link to the URL. When victims click the link, they unwittingly reflect the malicious content through the vulnerable web application back to their own computers. This mechanism of exploiting vulnerable web applications is known as Reflected XSS.<br><br><b>Example 2:</b> The following Python code segment queries a database for an employee with a given ID and prints the corresponding HTML-encoded employee's name.<br><br><pre><br> ...<br> cursor.execute("select * from emp where id="+eid)<br> row = cursor.fetchone()<br> self.writeln('Employee name: ' + escape(row["emp"]))<br> ...<br></pre><br><br>As in Example 1, this code functions correctly when the values of <code>name</code> are well-behaved, but it does nothing to prevent exploits if they are not. Again, this code can appear less dangerous because the value of <code>name</code> is read from a database, whose contents are apparently managed by the application. However, if the value of <code>name</code> originates from user-supplied data, then the database can be a conduit for malicious content. Without proper input validation on all data stored in the database, an attacker can execute malicious commands in the user's web browser. This type of exploit, known as Persistent (or Stored) XSS, is particularly insidious because the indirection caused by the data store makes it more difficult to identify the threat and increases the possibility that the attack will affect multiple users. XSS got its start in this form with web sites that offered a "guestbook" to visitors. Attackers would include JavaScript in their guestbook entries, and all subsequent visitors to the guestbook page would execute the malicious code.<br><br>As the examples demonstrate, XSS vulnerabilities are caused by code that includes unvalidated data in an HTTP response. There are three vectors by which an XSS attack can reach a victim:<br><br>- As in Example 1, data is read directly from the HTTP request and reflected back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a user to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the user and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to victims. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces victims to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the user, the content is executed and proceeds to transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the user's machine to the attacker or perform other nefarious activities.<br><br>- As in Example 2, the application stores dangerous data in a database or other trusted data store. The dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. Persistent XSS exploits occur when an attacker injects dangerous content into a data store that is later read and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user.<br><br>- A source outside the application stores dangerous data in a database or other data store, and the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application as trusted data and included in dynamic content.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Interpreting user-controlled instructions at run-time can allow attackers to execute malicious code.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Many modern programming languages allow dynamic interpretation of source instructions. This capability allows programmers to perform dynamic instructions based on input received from the user. Code injection vulnerabilities occur when the programmer incorrectly assumes that instructions supplied directly from the user will perform only innocent operations, such as performing simple calculations on active user objects or otherwise modifying the user's state. However, without proper validation, a user might specify operations the programmer does not intend.<br><IfDef var="ConditionalDescriptions"><br> <br></IfDef><br><br><b>Example:</b> In this classic code injection example, the application implements a basic calculator that allows the user to specify commands for execution.<br><br><pre><br>...<br>userOps = request.GET['operation']<br>result = eval(userOps)<br>...<br></pre><br><br>The program behaves correctly when the <code>operation</code> parameter is a benign value, such as &quot;8 + 7 * 2&quot;, in which case the <code>result</code> variable is assigned a value of 22. However, if an attacker specifies operations that are both valid and malicious, those operations would be executed with the full privilege of the parent process.  Such attacks are even more dangerous when the underlying language provides access to system resources or allows execution of system commands. For example, if an attacker were to specify &quot; os.system('shutdown -h now')&quot; as the value of  <code>operation</code>, a shutdown command would be executed on the host system.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Deserializing user-controlled data at run-time can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Python Official documentation states that:<br><br><code><br>The pickle module is not intended to be secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Including unvalidated data in an HTTP response header can enable cache-poisoning, cross-site scripting, cross-user defacement, page hijacking, cookie manipulation or open redirect.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Header Manipulation vulnerabilities occur when:<br><br>1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.<br><br><IfDef var="ConditionalDescriptions"><br> <br></IfDef><br><br>2. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without being validated.<br><br>As with many software security vulnerabilities, Header Manipulation is a means to an end, not an end in itself. At its root, the vulnerability is straightforward: an attacker passes malicious data to a vulnerable application, and the application includes the data in an HTTP response header.<br><br>One of the most common Header Manipulation attacks is HTTP Response Splitting. To mount a successful HTTP Response Splitting exploit, the application must allow input that contains CR (carriage return, also given by %0d or \r) and LF (line feed, also given by %0a or \n)characters into the header. These characters not only give attackers control of the remaining headers and body of the response the application intends to send, but also allows them to create additional responses entirely under their control.<br><br>Many of today's modern application servers will prevent the injection of malicious characters into HTTP headers. If your application server prevents setting headers with new line characters, then your application is not vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting. However, solely filtering for new line characters can leave an application vulnerable to Cookie Manipulation or Open Redirects, so care must still be taken when setting HTTP headers with user input.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code segment reads the location from an HTTP request and sets it in a the header its location field of an HTTP response.<br><br><pre><br>    location = req.field('some_location')<br>    ...<br>    response.addHeader("location",location)<br></pre><br><br>Assuming a string consisting of standard alpha-numeric characters, such as "index.html", is submitted in the request the HTTP response including this cookie might take the following form:<br><br><pre><br>HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br>...<br>location: index.html<br>...<br></pre><br><br>However, because the value of the location is formed of unvalidated user input the response will only maintain this form if the value submitted for <code>some_location</code> does not contain any CR and LF characters. If an attacker submits a malicious string, such as "index.html\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n...", then the HTTP response would be split into two responses of the following form:<br><br><pre><br>HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br>...<br>location: index.html<br><br>HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br>...<br></pre><br><br>Clearly, the second response is completely controlled by the attacker and can be constructed with any header and body content desired. The ability of attacker to construct arbitrary HTTP responses permits a variety of resulting attacks, including: cross-user defacement, web and browser cache poisoning, cross-site scripting and page hijacking.<br><br><b>Cross-User Defacement:</b> An attacker can make a single request to a vulnerable server that will cause the server to create two responses, the second of which may be misinterpreted as a response to a different request, possibly one made by another user sharing the same TCP connection with the server. This can be accomplished by convincing the user to submit the malicious request themselves, or remotely in situations where the attacker and the user share a common TCP connection to the server, such as a shared proxy server. In the best case, an attacker can leverage this ability to convince users that the application has been hacked, causing users to lose confidence in the security of the application. In the worst case, an attacker may provide specially crafted content designed to mimic the behavior of the application but redirect private information, such as account numbers and passwords, back to the attacker.<br><br><b>Cache Poisoning:</b> The impact of a maliciously constructed response can be magnified if it is cached either by a web cache used by multiple users or even the browser cache of a single user. If a response is cached in a shared web cache, such as those commonly found in proxy servers, then all users of that cache will continue receive the malicious content until the cache entry is purged. Similarly, if the response is cached in the browser of an individual user, then that user will continue to receive the malicious content until the cache entry is purged, although only the user of the local browser instance will be affected.<br><br><b>Cross-Site Scripting:</b> Once attackers have control of the responses sent by an application, they have a choice of a variety of malicious content to provide users. Cross-site scripting is common form of attack where malicious JavaScript or other code included in a response is executed in the user's browser. The variety of attacks based on XSS is almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting private data like cookies or other session information to the attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site. The most common and dangerous attack vector against users of a vulnerable application uses JavaScript to transmit session and authentication information back to the attacker who can then take complete control of the victim's account.<br><br><b>Page Hijacking:</b> In addition to using a vulnerable application to send malicious content to a user, the same root vulnerability can also be leveraged to redirect sensitive content generated by the server and intended for the user to the attacker instead. By submitting a request that results in two responses, the intended response from the server and the response generated by the attacker, an attacker can cause an intermediate node, such as a shared proxy server, to misdirect a response generated by the server for the user to the attacker. Because the request made by the attacker generates two responses, the first is interpreted as a response to the attacker's request, while the second remains in limbo. When the user makes a legitimate request through the same TCP connection, the attacker's request is already waiting and is interpreted as a response to the victim's request. The attacker then sends a second request to the server, to which the proxy server responds with the server generated request intended for the victim, thereby compromising any sensitive information in the headers or body of the response intended for the victim.<br><br><b>Cookie Manipulation:</b> When combined with attacks like Cross-Site Request Forgery, attackers can change, add to, or even overwrite a legitimate user's cookies.<br><br><b>Open Redirect:</b> Allowing unvalidated input to control the URL used in a redirect can aid phishing attacks.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Including unvalidated data in an SMTP header can enable attackers to add arbitrary headers, such as <code>CC</code> or <code>BCC</code> that can be used to leak the mail contents to themselves or use the mail server as a spam bot.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  SMTP Header Manipulation vulnerabilities occur when:<br><br>1. Data enters an application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request in a web application.<br><br>2. The data is included in an SMTP header sent to a mail server without being validated.<br><br>As with many software security vulnerabilities, SMTP Header Manipulation is a means to an end, not an end in itself. At its root, the vulnerability is straightforward: an attacker passes malicious data to a vulnerable application, and the application includes the data in an SMTP header.<br><br>One of the most common SMTP Header Manipulation attacks is for the use of distributing spam emails. If an application contains a vulnerable "Contact us" form that allows setting the subject and the body of the email, an attacker will be able to set any arbitrary content and inject a <code>CC</code> header with a list of email addresses to spam anonymously since the email will be sent from the victim server.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code segment reads the subject and body of a "Contact us" form:<br><br><pre><br>body = request.GET['body']<br>subject = request.GET['subject']<br>session = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_tls_port)<br>session.ehlo()<br>session.starttls()<br>session.login(username, password)<br>headers = "\r\n".join(["from: webform@acme.com",<br>                       "subject: [Contact us query] " + subject,<br>                       "to: support@acme.com",<br>                       "mime-version: 1.0",<br>                       "content-type: text/html"])<br>content = headers + "\r\n\r\n" + body<br>session.sendmail("webform@acme.com", "support@acme.com", content)<br></pre><br><br>Assuming a string consisting of standard alpha-numeric characters, such as "Page not working" is submitted in the request, the SMTP headers might take the following form:<br><br><pre><br>...<br>subject: [Contact us query] Page not working<br>...<br></pre><br><br>However, because the value of the header is constructed from unvalidated user input the response will only maintain this form if the value submitted for <code>subject</code> does not contain any CR and LF characters. If an attacker submits a malicious string, such as "Congratulations!! You won the lottery!!!\r\ncc:victim1@mail.com,victim2@mail.com ...", then the SMTP headers would be of the following form:<br><br><pre><br>...<br>subject: [Contact us query] Congratulations!! You won the lottery<br>cc: victim1@mail.com,victim2@mail.com<br>...<br></pre><br><br>This will effectively allow an attacker to craft spam messages or to send anonymous emails amongst other attacks.

							<p>
							  Writing unvalidated user input to log files can allow an attacker to forge log entries or inject malicious content into the logs.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Log forging vulnerabilities occur when:<br><br>1. Data enters an application from an untrusted source.<br><br>2. The data is written to an application or system log file.<br><br>Applications typically use log files to store a history of events or transactions for later review, statistics gathering, or debugging. Depending on the nature of the application, the task of reviewing log files may be performed manually on an as-needed basis or automated with a tool that automatically culls logs for important events or trending information.<br><br>Interpretation of the log files may be hindered or misdirected if an attacker can supply data to the application that is subsequently logged verbatim. In the most benign case, an attacker may be able to insert false entries into the log file by providing the application with input that includes appropriate characters. If the log file is processed automatically, the attacker can render the file unusable by corrupting the format of the file or injecting unexpected characters. A more subtle attack might involve skewing the log file statistics. Forged or otherwise, corrupted log files can be used to cover an attacker's tracks or even to implicate another party in the commission of a malicious act [1]. In the worst case, an attacker may inject code or other commands into the log file and take advantage of a vulnerability in the log processing utility [2].<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following web application code attempts to read an integer value from a request object. If the value fails to parse as an integer, then the input is logged with an error message indicating what happened.<br><br><pre><br>    name = req.field('name')<br>    ...<br>    logout = req.field('logout')<br><br>    if (logout):<br>        ...<br>    else:<br>        logger.error("Attempt to log out: name: %s logout: %s" % (name,logout))<br></pre><br><br>If a user submits the string "<code>twenty-one</code>" for <code>logout</code> and he was able to create a user with name "<code>admin</code>", the following entry is logged:<br><br><pre><br>Attempt to log out: name: admin logout: twenty-one<br></pre><br><br>However, if an attacker is able to create a username "<code>admin+logout:+1+++++++++++++++++++++++</code>", the following entry is logged:<br><br><pre><br>Attempt to log out: name: admin logout: 1                       logout: twenty-one<br></pre>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Allowing unvalidated input to control the URL used in a redirect can aid phishing attacks.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Redirects allow web applications to direct users to different pages within the same application or to external sites. Applications utilize redirects to aid in site navigation and, in some cases, to track how users exit the site. Open redirect vulnerabilities occur when a web application redirects clients to any arbitrary URL that can be controlled by an attacker.<br><br>Attackers can utilize open redirects to trick users into visiting a URL to a trusted site and redirecting them to a malicious site. By encoding the URL, an attacker can make it more difficult for end-users to notice the malicious destination of the redirect, even when it is passed as a URL parameter to the trusted site. Open redirects are often abused as part of phishing scams to harvest sensitive end-user data.<br><br><br><br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following Python code instructs the user's browser to open a URL parsed from the <code>dest</code> request parameter when a user clicks the link.<br><br><pre><br>        ...<br>        strDest = request.field("dest")<br>        redirect(strDest)<br>        ...<br></pre><br><br>If a victim received an email instructing the user to follow a link to &quot;http://trusted.example.com/ecommerce/redirect.asp?dest=www.wilyhacker.com&quot;, the user would likely click on the link believing they would be transferred to the trusted site. However, when the user clicks the link, the code above will redirect the browser to &quot;http://www.wilyhacker.com&quot;.<br><br>Many users have been educated to always inspect URLs they receive in emails to make sure the link specifies a trusted site they know. However, if the attacker Hex encoded the destination url as follows:<br> &quot;http://trusted.example.com/ecommerce/redirect.asp?dest=%77%69%6C%79%68%61%63%6B%65%72%2E%63%6F%6D&quot;<br><br>then even a savvy end-user may be fooled into following the link.

							<p>
							  Allowing user input to control paths used in filesystem operations could enable an attacker to access or modify otherwise protected system resources.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Path manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:<br><br>1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.<br><br>2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.<br><br>For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.<br><br><IfDef var="ConditionalDescriptions"><br> <br></IfDef><br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following code uses input from an HTTP request to create a file name. The programmer has not considered the possibility that an attacker could provide a file name such as "<code>../../tomcat/conf/server.xml</code>", which causes the application to delete one of its own configuration files.<br><br><pre><br>rName = req.field('reportName')<br>rFile = os.open("/usr/local/apfr/reports/" + rName)<br>...<br>os.unlink(rFile);<br></pre><br><br><b>Example 2:</b> The following code uses input from a configuration file to determine which file to open and echo back to the user. If the program runs with privileges and malicious users can change the configuration file, they can use the program to read any file on the system that ends with the extension <code>.txt</code>.<br><br><pre><br>...<br>filename = CONFIG_TXT['sub'] + ".txt";<br>handle = os.open(filename)<br>print handle<br>...<br></pre>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Allowing user input to control resource identifiers could enable an attacker to access or modify otherwise protected system resources.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  A resource injection issue occurs when the following two conditions are met:<br><br>1. An attacker can specify the identifier used to access a system resource.<br><br>For example, an attacker may be able to specify a port number to be used to connect to a network resource.<br><br>2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.<br><br>For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to transmit sensitive information to a third-party server.<br><br><br><br>Note: Resource injection that involves resources stored on the filesystem goes by the name path manipulation and is reported in separate category. See the path manipulation description for further details of this vulnerability.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code uses a hostname read from an HTTP request to connect to a database, which determines the price for a ticket.<br><br><pre><br>host=request.GET['host']<br>dbconn = db.connect(host=host, port=1234, dbname=ticketdb)<br>c = dbconn.cursor()<br>...<br>result = c.execute('SELECT * FROM pricelist')<br>...<br></pre><br><br>The kind of resource affected by user input indicates the kind of content that may be dangerous.  For example, data containing special characters like period, slash, and backslash are risky when used in methods that interact with the file system. Similarly, data that contains URLs and URIs is risky for functions that create remote connections.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Constructing a dynamic SQL statement with input coming from an untrusted source could allow an attacker to modify the statement's meaning or to execute arbitrary SQL commands. 
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  SQL injection errors occur when:<br><br>1. Data enters a program from an untrusted source.<br><br>2. The data is used to dynamically construct a SQL query.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following code dynamically constructs and executes a SQL query that searches for items matching a specified name. The query restricts the items displayed to those where the owner matches the user name of the currently-authenticated user.<br><br><pre><br>	...<br>	userName = req.field('userName')<br>	itemName = req.field('itemName')<br>	query = "SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = ' " + userName +" ' AND itemname = ' " + itemName +"';"<br>	cursor.execute(query)<br>	result = cursor.fetchall()<br>	...<br></pre><br><br>The query that this code intends to execute follows:<br><br><pre><br>	SELECT * FROM items<br>	WHERE owner = &lt;userName&gt;<br>	AND itemname = &lt;itemName&gt;;<br></pre><br><br>However, because the query is constructed dynamically by concatenating a constant query string and a user input string, the query only behaves correctly if <code>itemName</code> does not contain a single-quote character. If an attacker with the user name <code>wiley</code> enters the string "<code>name' OR 'a'='a</code>" for <code>itemName</code>, then the query becomes the following:<br><br><pre><br>	SELECT * FROM items<br>	WHERE owner = 'wiley'<br>	AND itemname = 'name' OR 'a'='a';<br></pre><br><br>The addition of the <code>OR 'a'='a'</code> condition causes the where clause to always evaluate to true, so the query becomes logically equivalent to the much simpler query:<br><br><pre><br>	SELECT * FROM items;<br></pre><br><br>This simplification of the query allows the attacker to bypass the requirement that the query only return items owned by the authenticated user; the query now returns all entries stored in the <code>items</code> table, regardless of their specified owner.<br><br><b>Example 2:</b> This example examines the effects of a different malicious value passed to the query constructed and executed in Example 1. If an attacker with the user name <code>wiley</code> enters the string "<code>name'; DELETE FROM items; --</code>" for <code>itemName</code>, then the query becomes the following two queries:<br><br><pre><br>	SELECT * FROM items<br>	WHERE owner = 'wiley'<br>	AND itemname = 'name';<br><br>	DELETE FROM items;<br><br>	--'<br></pre><br><br>Many database servers, including Microsoft(R) SQL Server 2000, allow multiple SQL statements separated by semicolons to be executed at once. While this attack string results in an error on Oracle and other database servers that do not allow the batch-execution of statements separated by semicolons, on databases that do allow batch execution, this type of attack allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands against the database.<br><br>Notice the trailing pair of hyphens (--), which specifies to most database servers that the remainder of the statement is to be treated as a comment and not executed [4]. In this case the comment character serves to remove the trailing single-quote left over from the modified query. On a database where comments are not allowed to be used in this way, the general attack could still be made effective using a trick similar to the one shown in Example 1. If an attacker enters the string "<code>name'); DELETE FROM items; SELECT * FROM items WHERE 'a'='a</code>", the following three valid statements will be created:<br><br><pre><br>	SELECT * FROM items<br>	WHERE owner = 'wiley'<br>	AND itemname = 'name';<br><br>	DELETE FROM items;<br><br>	SELECT * FROM items WHERE 'a'='a';<br></pre><br><br>One traditional approach to preventing SQL injection attacks is to handle them as an input validation problem and either accept only characters from a whitelist of safe values or identify and escape a blacklist of potentially malicious values. Whitelisting can be a very effective means of enforcing strict input validation rules, but parameterized SQL statements require less maintenance and can offer more guarantees with respect to security. As is almost always the case, blacklisting is riddled with loopholes that make it ineffective at preventing SQL injection attacks. For example, attackers can:<br><br>- Target fields that are not quoted<br><br>- Find ways to bypass the need for certain escaped meta-characters<br><br>- Use stored procedures to hide the injected meta-characters<br><br>Manually escaping characters in input to SQL queries can help, but it will not make your application secure from SQL injection attacks.<br><br>Another solution commonly proposed for dealing with SQL injection attacks is to use stored procedures. Although stored procedures prevent some types of SQL injection attacks, they fail to protect against many others. Stored procedures typically help prevent SQL injection attacks by limiting the types of statements that can be passed to their parameters. However, there are many ways around the limitations and many interesting statements that can still be passed to stored procedures. Again, stored procedures can prevent some exploits, but they will not make your application secure against SQL injection attacks.

							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  A Server-Side Request Forgery occurs when an attacker can influence a network connection made by the application server. The network connection will originate from the application server internal IP and an attacker will be able to use this connection to bypass network controls and scan or attack internal resources that are not otherwise exposed.<br><br><br><IfDef var="ConditionalDescriptions"><br> <br></IfDef><br><br><b>Example:</b> In the following example, an attacker will be able to control the URL the server is connecting to.<br><br><pre><br>url = request.GET['url']<br>handle = urllib.urlopen(url)<br></pre><br><br>The ability of the attacker to hijack the network connection will depend on the specific part of the URI that he can control and on libraries used to stablish the connection. For example, controlling the URI scheme will let the attacker use protocols different from <code>http</code> or <code>https</code> like:<br><br>- up://<br>- ldap://<br>- jar://<br>- gopher://<br>- mailto://<br>- ssh2://<br>- telnet://<br>- expect://<br><br>An attacker will be able to leverage this hijacked network connection to perform the following attacks:<br><br>- Port Scanning of intranet resources.<br>- Bypass firewalls.<br>- Attack vulnerable programs running on the application server or on the Intranet.<br>- Attack internal/external web applications using Injection attacks or CSRF.<br>- Access local files using file:// scheme.<br>- On Windows systems, file:// scheme and UNC paths can allow an attacker to scan and access internal shares.<br>- Perform a DNS cache poisoning attack.<br><br>

							  Allowing external control of system settings can disrupt service or cause an application to behave in unexpected ways.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  An attacker may be able to create unexpected control flow paths through the application, potentially bypassing security checks.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  If an attacker can supply values that the application then uses to determine which class to instantiate or which method to invoke, the potential exists for the attacker to create control flow paths through the application that were not intended by the application developers. This attack vector may allow the attacker to bypass authentication or access control checks or otherwise cause the application to behave in an unexpected manner. Even the ability to control the arguments passed to a given method or constructor may give a wily attacker the edge necessary to mount a successful attack.<br><br>This situation becomes a doomsday scenario if the attacker can upload files into a location that appears on the application's classpath or add new entries to the application's classpath. Under either of these conditions, the attacker can use reflection to introduce new, presumably malicious, behavior into the application.<br><br>

							<p>
							  Using XML parsers configured to not prevent nor limit Document Type Definition (DTD) entity resolution can expose the parser to an XML Entity Expansion injection

							  XML Entity Expansion injection also known as XML Bombs are DoS attacks that benefit from valid and well-formed XML blocks that expand exponentially until they exhaust the server allocated resources. XML allows to define custom entities which act as string substitution macros. By nesting recurrent entity resolutions, an attacker can easily crash the server resources.<br><br>The following XML document shows an example of an XML Bomb.<br><pre><br>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;<br>&lt;!DOCTYPE lolz [<br>  &lt;!ENTITY lol "lol"&gt;<br>  &lt;!ENTITY lol2 "&amp;lol;&amp;lol;&amp;lol;&amp;lol;&amp;lol;&amp;lol;&amp;lol;&amp;lol;&amp;lol;&amp;lol;"&gt;<br>  &lt;!ENTITY lol3 "&amp;lol2;&amp;lol2;&amp;lol2;&amp;lol2;&amp;lol2;&amp;lol2;&amp;lol2;&amp;lol2;&amp;lol2;&amp;lol2;"&gt;<br>  &lt;!ENTITY lol4 "&amp;lol3;&amp;lol3;&amp;lol3;&amp;lol3;&amp;lol3;&amp;lol3;&amp;lol3;&amp;lol3;&amp;lol3;&amp;lol3;"&gt;<br>  &lt;!ENTITY lol5 "&amp;lol4;&amp;lol4;&amp;lol4;&amp;lol4;&amp;lol4;&amp;lol4;&amp;lol4;&amp;lol4;&amp;lol4;&amp;lol4;"&gt;<br>  &lt;!ENTITY lol6 "&amp;lol5;&amp;lol5;&amp;lol5;&amp;lol5;&amp;lol5;&amp;lol5;&amp;lol5;&amp;lol5;&amp;lol5;&amp;lol5;"&gt;<br>  &lt;!ENTITY lol7 "&amp;lol6;&amp;lol6;&amp;lol6;&amp;lol6;&amp;lol6;&amp;lol6;&amp;lol6;&amp;lol6;&amp;lol6;&amp;lol6;"&gt;<br>  &lt;!ENTITY lol8 "&amp;lol7;&amp;lol7;&amp;lol7;&amp;lol7;&amp;lol7;&amp;lol7;&amp;lol7;&amp;lol7;&amp;lol7;&amp;lol7;"&gt;<br>  &lt;!ENTITY lol9 "&amp;lol8;&amp;lol8;&amp;lol8;&amp;lol8;&amp;lol8;&amp;lol8;&amp;lol8;&amp;lol8;&amp;lol8;&amp;lol8;"&gt;<br>]&gt;<br>&lt;lolz&gt;&amp;lol9;&lt;/lolz&gt;<br></pre><br><br>This test could crash the server by expanding the small XML document into more than 3GB in memory.<br>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Using XML processors that do not prevent nor limit external entities resolution can expose the application to XML External Entities attacks
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  XML External Entities attacks benefit from an XML feature to build documents dynamically at the time of processing. An XML entity allows inclusion of data dynamically from a given resource. External entities allow an XML document to include data from an external URI. Unless configured to do otherwise, external entities force the XML parser to access the resource specified by the URI, e.g., a file on the local machine or on a remote system. This behavior exposes the application to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, which can be used to perform denial of service of the local system, gain unauthorized access to files on the local machine, scan remote machines, and perform denial of service of remote systems.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following XML document shows an example of an XXE attack.<br><pre><br>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;<br> &lt;!DOCTYPE foo [<br>  &lt;!ELEMENT foo ANY &gt;<br>  &lt;!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///dev/random" &gt;]&gt;&lt;foo&gt;&amp;xxe;&lt;/foo&gt;<br></pre><br><br>This example could crash the server (on a UNIX system), if the XML parser attempts to substitute the entity with the contents of the /dev/random file.<br>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Writing unvalidated data into an XML document can allow an attacker to change the structure and contents of the XML.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  XML injection occurs when:<br><br>1. Data enters a program from an untrusted source.<br><br>2. The data is written to an XML document.<br><br>Applications typically use XML to store data or send messages. When used to store data, XML documents are often treated like databases and can potentially contain sensitive information. XML messages are often used in web services and can also be used to transmit sensitive information. XML message can even be used to send authentication credentials.<br><br>The semantics of XML documents and messages can be altered if an attacker has the ability to write raw XML. In the most benign case, an attacker may be able to insert extraneous tags and cause an XML parser to throw an exception. In more nefarious cases of XML injection, an attacker may be able to add XML elements that change authentication credentials or modify prices in an XML e-commerce database. In some cases, XML injection can lead to cross-site scripting or dynamic code evaluation.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b><br><br>Assume an attacker is able to control <code>shoes</code> in following XML.<br><pre><br>&lt;order&gt;<br>&lt;price&gt;100.00&lt;/price&gt;<br>&lt;item&gt;shoes&lt;/item&gt;<br>&lt;/order&gt;<br></pre><br><br>Now imagine this XML is included in a back end web service request to place an order for a pair of shoes. Suppose the attacker modifies his request and replaces <code>shoes</code> with <code>shoes&lt;/item&gt;&lt;price&gt;1.00&lt;/price&gt;&lt;item&gt;shoes</code>. The new XML would look like:<pre><br>&lt;order&gt;   &lt;price&gt;100.00&lt;/price&gt;   &lt;item&gt;shoes&lt;/item&gt;&lt;price&gt;1.00&lt;/price&gt;&lt;item&gt;shoes&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/order&gt;<br></pre><br><br>When using SAX parsers, the value from the second <code>&lt;price&gt;</code> overrides the value from the first <code>&lt;price&gt;</code> tag. This allows the attacker to purchase a pair of $100 shoes for $1.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Constructing a dynamic XPath query with user input could allow an attacker to modify the statement's meaning. 
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  XPath injection occurs when:<br><br>1.      Data enters a program from an untrusted source.<br><br><br><br>2.      The data is used to dynamically construct an XPath query.<br><br><br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following code dynamically constructs and executes an XPath query that retrieves an e-mail address for a given account ID. The account ID is read from an HTTP request, and is therefore untrusted.<br><br><pre><br>...<br>tree = etree.parse('articles.xml')<br>emailAddrs = "/accounts/account[acctID=" + request.GET["test1"] + "]/email/text()"<br>r = tree.xpath(emailAddrs)<br>...<br></pre><br><br>Under normal conditions, such as searching for an e-mail address that belongs to the account number 1, the query that this code executes will look like the following:<br><br><code>/accounts/account[acctID='1']/email/text()</code><br><br>However, because the query is constructed dynamically by concatenating a constant query string and a user input string, the query only behaves correctly if <code>acctID</code> does not contain a single-quote character. If an attacker enters the string <code>1' or '1' = '1</code> for <code>acctID</code>, then the query becomes the following:<br><br><code>/accounts/account[acctID='1' or '1' = '1']/email/text()</code><br><br>The addition of the <code>1' or '1' = '1</code> condition causes the where clause to always evaluate to true, so the query becomes logically equivalent to the much simpler query:<br><br><code>//email/text()</code><br><br>This simplification of the query allows the attacker to bypass the requirement that the query only return items owned by the authenticated user; the query now returns all e-mail addresses stored in the document, regardless of their specified owner.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Processing an unvalidated XSL stylesheet can allow an attacker to change the structure and contents of the resultant XML, include arbitrary files from the file system, or execute arbitrary Java code.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  XSLT injection occurs when:<br><br>1. Data enters a program from an untrusted source.<br><br>2. The data is written to an XSL stylesheet.<br><br><br>Applications typically use XSL stylesheet to transform XML documents from one format to another.  XSL stylesheets include special functions which enhance the transformation process but introduce additional vulnerabilities if used incorrectly.<br><br>The semantics of XSL stylesheets and processing can be altered if an attacker has the ability to write XSL elements in a stylesheet. An attacker could alter the output of a stylesheet such that a XSS (cross-site scripting) attack was enabled, expose the contents of local file system resources, or execute arbitrary Java commands.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> Here is some code that is vulnerable to XSLT Injection:<br><br><pre><br>...<br>xml = StringIO.StringIO(request.POST['xml'])<br>xslt = StringIO.StringIO(request.POST['xslt'])<br><br>xslt_root = etree.XML(xslt)<br>transform = etree.XSLT(xslt_root)<br>result_tree = transform(xml)<br>return render_to_response(template_name, {'result': etree.tostring(result_tree)})<br>...<br></pre><br><br>The code above results in three different exploits when the attacker can pass the identified XSL to the XSTL processor:<br><br>1.  XSS:<br><br><code><br><br>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"&gt;<br>  &lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;<br>    &lt;script&gt;alert(123)&lt;/script&gt;<br>  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;<br>&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;<br><br></code><br><br>When the XSL stylesheet is processed, the &lt;script&gt; tag is rendered to the victim's browser allowing a cross-site scripting attack to be performed.<br><br>2.  Reading of arbitrary files on the server's file system:<br><br><code><br><br>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"&gt;<br>  &lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;<br>    &lt;xsl:copy-of select="document('/etc/passwd')"/&gt;<br>  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;<br>&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;<br><br></code><br><br>The above XSL stylesheet will return the contents of the /etc/passwd file.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Without proper access control, executing a SQL statement that contains a user-controlled primary key can allow an attacker to view unauthorized records.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Database access control errors occur when:<br><br>1.  Data enters a program from an untrusted source.<br><br><br>2.  The data is used to specify the value of a primary key in a SQL query.<br><br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following code uses a parameterized statement, which escapes metacharacters and prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities, to construct and execute a SQL query that searches for an invoice matching the specified identifier [1]. The identifier is selected from a list of all invoices associated with the current authenticated user.<br><br><pre><br>...<br>id = request.POST['id']<br>c = db.cursor()<br>stmt = c.execute("SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE id = %s", (id,))<br>...<br></pre><br><br>The problem is that the developer has failed to consider all of the possible values of <code>id</code>. Although the interface generates a list of invoice identifiers that belong to the current user, an attacker can bypass this interface to request any desired invoice. Because the code in this example does not check to ensure that the user has permission to access the requested invoice, it will display any invoice, even if it does not belong to the current user.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Standard pseudo-random number generators cannot withstand cryptographic attacks.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Insecure randomness errors occur when a function that can produce predictable values is used as a source of randomness in security-sensitive context.<br><br>Computers are deterministic machines, and as such are unable to produce true randomness. Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) approximate randomness algorithmically, starting with a seed from which subsequent values are calculated.<br><br>There are two types of PRNGs: statistical and cryptographic. Statistical PRNGs provide useful statistical properties, but their output is highly predictable and forms an easy to reproduce numeric stream that is unsuitable for use in cases where security depends on generated values being unpredictable. Cryptographic PRNGs address this problem by generating output that is more difficult to predict. For a value to be cryptographically secure, it must be impossible or highly improbable for an attacker to distinguish between it and a truly random value. In general, if a PRNG algorithm is not advertised as being cryptographically secure, then it is probably a statistical PRNG and should not be used in security-sensitive contexts, where its use can lead to serious vulnerabilities such as easy-to-guess temporary passwords, predictable cryptographic keys, session hijacking, and DNS spoofing.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code uses a statistical PRNG to create a URL for a receipt that remains active for some period of time after a purchase.<br><br><pre><br>    def genReceiptURL(self,baseURL):<br>        randNum = random.random()<br>        receiptURL = baseURL + randNum + ".html"<br>        return receiptURL<br></pre><br><br>This code uses the <code>rand()</code> function to generate "unique" identifiers for the receipt pages it generates. Because <code>rand()</code> is a statistical PRNG, it is easy for an attacker to guess the strings it generates. Although the underlying design of the receipt system is also faulty, it would be more secure if it used a random number generator that did not produce predictable receipt identifiers, such as a cryptographic PRNG.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Empty passwords can compromise system security in a way that cannot be easily remedied.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  It is never a good idea to assign an empty string to a password variable. If the empty password is used to successfully authenticate against another system, then the corresponding account's security is likely compromised because it accepts an empty password. If the empty password is merely a placeholder until a legitimate value can be assigned to the variable, then it can confuse anyone unfamiliar with the code and potentially cause problems on unexpected control flow paths.<br><br><br><br><b>Example:</b> The code below attempts to connect to a database with an empty password.<br><pre><br>...<br>db = mysql.connect("localhost","scott","","mydb")<br>...<br></pre><br><br>If the code in the Example succeeds, it indicates that the database user account "scott" is configured with an empty password, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. Even worse, once the program has shipped, updating the account to use a non-empty password will require a code change.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Hardcoded passwords could compromise system security in a way that cannot be easily remedied.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  It is never a good idea to hardcode a password. Not only does hardcoding a password allow all of the project's developers to view the password, it also makes fixing the problem extremely difficult. Once the code is in production, the password cannot be changed without patching the software. If the account protected by the password is compromised, the owners of the system will be forced to choose between security and availability.<br><br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code hardcodes a password:<br><br><pre><br>        pwd = "tiger"<br>        ...<br>		response.writeln("Password:" + pwd)<br>?&gt;<br></pre><br><br>This code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to it will have access to the password. Once the program has shipped, there is no going back from a password of "tiger" unless the program is patched. A devious employee with access to this information can use it to break into the system. Even worse, if attackers have access to the binary for the application they can use one of many publicly available decompilers to access the disassembled code, which will contain the values of the passwords used.

							<p>
							  Null passwords can compromise security.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Assigning null to password variables is a bad idea because it can allow attackers to bypass password verification or might indicate that resources are protected by an empty password.<br><br><br><br><b>Example:</b> The code below initializes a password variable to null, attempts to read a stored value for the password, and compares it against a user-supplied value.<br><br><pre><br>...<br>storedPassword = NULL;<br><br>temp = getPassword()<br>if (temp is not None) {<br>  storedPassword = temp;<br>}<br><br>if(storedPassword == userPassword) {<br>    // Access protected resources<br>    ...<br>}<br>...<br></pre><br><br>If <code>getPassword()</code> fails to retrieve the stored password due to a database error or another problem, then an attacker could trivially bypass the password check by providing a null value for <code>userPassword</code>.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Storing passwords or password details in plaintext anywhere in the system or system code can compromise system security in a way that cannot be easily remedied.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  It is never a good idea to hardcode a password. Storing password details within comments is equivalent to hardcoding passwords.  Not only does it allow all of the project's developers to view the password, it also makes fixing the problem extremely difficult. Once the code is in production, the password is now leaked to the outside world and cannot be protected or changed without patching the software. If the account protected by the password is compromised, the owners of the system will be forced to choose between security and availability.<br><br><br><b>Example:</b> The following comment specifies the default password to connect to a database:<br><br><pre><br>...<br># Default username for database connection is "scott"<br># Default password for database connection is "tiger"<br>...<br></pre><br><br>This code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to it will have access to the password. Once the program has shipped, there is no going back from the database user "scott" with a password of "tiger" unless the program is patched. A devious employee with access to this information can use it to break into the system.

							  Obscuring a password with a trivial encoding does not protect the password.

							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties or configuration file. A programmer can attempt to remedy the password management problem by obscuring the password with an encoding function, such as base 64 encoding, but this effort does not adequately protect the password.<br><br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code reads a password from a properties file and uses the password to connect to a database.<br><br><pre><br>...<br>props = os.open('config.properties')<br>password = base64.b64decode(props[0])<br><br>link = MySQLdb.connect (host = "localhost",<br>                           user = "testuser",<br>                           passwd = password,<br>                           db = "test")<br>...<br></pre><br><br>This code will run successfully, but anyone with access to <code>config.properties</code> can read the value of <code>password</code> and easily determine that the value has been base 64 encoded.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Weak cryptographic hashes cannot guarantee data integrity and should not be used in security-critical contexts.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  MD5 and SHA-1 are popular cryptographic hash algorithms often used to verify the integrity of messages and other data. Recent advances in cryptanalysis have discovered weaknesses in both algorithms. Consequently, MD5 and SHA-1 should no longer be relied upon to verify the authenticity of data in security-critical contexts.<br><br>Techniques for breaking MD5 hashes are advanced and widely available enough that the algorithm must not be relied upon for security. In the case of SHA-1, current techniques still require a significant amount of computational power and are more difficult to implement. However, attackers have found the Achilles heel for the algorithm, and techniques for breaking it will likely lead to the discovery of even faster attacks.

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Creating and using insecure temporary files can leave application and system data vulnerable to attacks.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Applications require temporary files so frequently that many different mechanisms exist for creating them. Most of these functions are vulnerable to various forms of attacks.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code uses a temporary file for storing intermediate data gathered from the network before it is processed.<br><br><pre><br>...<br>try:<br>  tmp_filename = os.tempnam()<br>  tmp_file = open(tmp_filename, 'w')<br>  data = s.recv(4096)<br>  while True:<br>      more = s.recv(4096)<br>      tmp_file.write(more)<br>      if not more:<br>        break<br>except socket.timeout:<br>  errMsg = "Connection timed-out while connecting"<br>  self.logger.exception(errMsg)<br>  raise Exception<br>...<br></pre><br><br>This otherwise unremarkable code is vulnerable to a number of different attacks because it relies on an insecure method for creating temporary files. The vulnerabilities introduced by this function and others are described in the following sections. The most egregious security problems related to temporary file creation have occurred on Unix-based operating systems, but Windows applications have parallel risks.<br><br>Methods and behaviors can vary between systems, but the fundamental risks introduced by each are reasonably constant. See the Recommendations section for information about safe core language functions and advice regarding a secure approach to creating temporary files.<br><br>The functions designed to aid in the creation of temporary files can be broken into two groups based on whether they simply provide a filename or actually open a new file.<br><br><b>Group 1 - "Unique" Filenames:</b><br><br>The first group of functions designed to help with the process of creating temporary files do so by generating a unique file name for a new temporary file, which the program is then supposed to open. This group of functions suffers from an underlying race condition on the filename chosen. Although the functions guarantee that the filename is unique at the time it is selected, there is no mechanism to prevent another process or an attacker from creating a file with the same name after it is selected but before the application attempts to open the file. Beyond the risk of a legitimate collision caused by another call to the same function, there is a high probability that an attacker will be able to create a malicious collision because the filenames generated by these functions are not sufficiently randomized to make them difficult to guess.<br><br>If a file with the selected name is created, then depending on how the file is opened the existing contents or access permissions of the file may remain intact. If the existing contents of the file are malicious in nature, an attacker may be able to inject dangerous data into the application when it reads data back from the temporary file. If an attacker pre-creates the file with relaxed access permissions, then data stored in the temporary file by the application may be accessed, modified or corrupted by an attacker. On Unix based systems an even more insidious attack is possible if the attacker pre-creates the file as a link to another important file. Then, if the application truncates or writes data to the file, it may unwittingly perform damaging operations for the attacker. This is an especially serious threat if the program operates with elevated permissions.<br><br>Finally, in the best case the file will be opened with a call to <code>open()</code> using the <code>os.O_CREAT</code> and <code>os.O_EXCL</code> flags, which will fail if the file already exists and therefore prevent the types of attacks described above. However, if an attacker is able to accurately predict a sequence of temporary file names, then the application may be prevented from opening necessary temporary storage causing a denial of service (DoS) attack. This type of attack would not be difficult to mount given the small amount of randomness used in the selection of the filenames generated by these functions.<br><br><b>Group 2 - "Unique" Files:</b><br><br>The second group of functions attempts to resolve some of the security problems related to temporary files by not only generating a unique file name, but also opening the file. This group includes functions like <code>tmpfile()</code>.<br><br>The <code>tmpfile()</code> style functions construct a unique filename and open it in the same way that <code>open()</code> would if passed the flags <code>"wb+"</code>, that is, as a binary file in read/write mode. If the file already exists, <code>tmpfile()</code> will truncate it to size zero, possibly in an attempt to assuage the security concerns mentioned earlier regarding the race condition that exists between the selection of a supposedly unique filename and the subsequent opening of the selected file. However, this behavior clearly does not solve the function's security problems. First, an attacker can pre-create the file with relaxed access-permissions that will likely be retained by the file opened by <code>tmpfile()</code>. Furthermore, on Unix based systems if the attacker pre-creates the file as a link to another important file, the application may use its possibly elevated permissions to truncate that file, thereby doing damage on behalf of the attacker. Finally, if <code>tmpfile()</code> does create a new file, the access permissions applied to that file will vary from one operating system to another, which can leave application data vulnerable even if an attacker is unable to predict the filename to be used in advance.
