							   System Field Overwrite
							</h1>
							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Overwriting system fields can destabilize the normal running of the system.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  ABAP system fields are always available in ABAP programs. The runtime system fills them according to context after starting a program, after sending a screen and after changing the internal mode. They can then be used in programs to query the system status. System fields are variables but should always be treated as though they were constants and be read only. Changing their values can cause the loss of important information necessary for the flow of the program. Only a limited few of these are meant to be changed within customer ABAP programs.<br><br><br>Changing values of system fields that communicate runtime specific information to the ABAP program could cause disruption or unexpected behavior in the ABAP program.<br>
