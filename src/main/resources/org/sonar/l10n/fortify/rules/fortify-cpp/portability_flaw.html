							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Functions with inconsistent implementations across operating systems and operating system versions cause portability problems.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  The behavior of functions in this category varies by operating system, and at times, even by operating system version. Implementation differences can include:<br><br>- Slight differences in the way parameters are interpreted leading to inconsistent results.<br><br>- Some implementations of the function carry significant security risks.<br><br>- The function might not be defined on all platforms.<br>
