							<p>
							  An attacker might be able to create unexpected control flow paths through the application, potentially bypassing security checks.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  If an attacker can supply values that the application then uses to determine which class to instantiate or which method to invoke, the potential exists for the attacker to create control flow paths through the application that were not intended by the application developers. This attack vector may allow the attacker to bypass authentication or access control checks or otherwise cause the application to behave in an unexpected manner.<br><br>This situation becomes a doomsday scenario if the attacker can upload files into a location that appears on the application's path or library path. Under either of these conditions, the attacker can use reflection to introduce new, presumably malicious, behavior into the application.<br><br><b>Example:</b> A common reason that programmers use the reflection API is to implement their own command dispatcher. The following example shows a JNI command dispatcher that uses reflection to execute a Java method identified by a value read from a CGI request. This implementation allows an attacker to call any function defined in <code>clazz</code>.<br><br><pre><br>char* ctl = getenv("ctl");<br>...<br>jmethodID mid = GetMethodID(clazz, ctl, sig); <br>status = CallIntMethod(env, clazz, mid, JAVA_ARGS); <br>...<br></pre><br>
