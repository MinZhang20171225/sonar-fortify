							<p>
							  Ignoring a method's return value can cause the program to overlook unexpected states and conditions.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Just about every serious attack on a software system begins with the violation of a programmer's assumptions. After the attack, the programmer's assumptions seem flimsy and poorly founded, but before an attack many programmers would defend their assumptions well past the end of their lunch break.<br><br>Two dubious assumptions that are easy to spot in code are "this function call can never fail" and "it doesn't matter if this function call fails". When a programmer ignores the return value from a function, they implicitly state that they are operating under one of these assumptions.<br><br><b>Example:</b> Consider the following code:<br><br><pre><br>char buf[10], cp_buf[10];<br>fgets(buf, 10, stdin);<br>strcpy(cp_buf, buf);<br></pre><br><br>The programmer expects that when <code>fgets()</code> returns, <code>buf</code> will contain a null-terminated string of length 9 or less. But if an I/O error occurs, <code>fgets()</code> will not null-terminate <code>buf</code>. Furthermore, if the end of the file is reached before any characters are read, <code>fgets()</code> returns without writing anything to <code>buf</code>. In both of these situations, <code>fgets()</code> signals that something unusual has happened by returning <code>NULL</code>, but in this code, the warning will not be noticed. The lack of a null terminator in <code>buf</code> can result in a buffer overflow in the subsequent call to <code>strcpy()</code>.
