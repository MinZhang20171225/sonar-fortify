							<p>
							  Executing arbitrary source instructions from an untrusted source can lead to malicious code execution.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Many modern languages allow dynamic interpretation of source instructions. This ability can be used when the programmer needs to perform user supplied instructions on data but would rather utilize the underlying language constructs instead of implementing code to interpret the user input. The user supplied instructions are expected to be innocent operations such as small calculations on active user objects, modification of the state of user objects, etc. However, if a programmer is not careful, a user may specify operations outside of the programmer's intentions. <br><br><b>Example:</b> A classic example application that may allow underlying programming constructs to be specified by the user is a calculator. The following ASP code accepts basic mathematical operations from the user to be computed and returned:<br><br><pre><br>...<br>	strUserOp = Request.Form('operation')<br>	strResult = Eval(strUserOp)<br>...<br></pre><br><br>The program's intended behavior holds in an example where the <code>operation</code> parameter is &quot;8 + 7 * 2&quot;. The <code>strResult</code> variable returns with a value of 22. However, if a user were to specify other valid language operations, those operations would not only be executed but executed with the full privilege of the parent process.  Arbitrary code execution becomes more dangerous when the underlying language provides access to system resources or allows execution of system commands. For example, if an attacker were to specify <code>operation</code> as &quot; Shell('C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\TSSHUTDN.EXE 0 /DELAY:0 /POWERDOWN')&quot; a shutdown command would be executed on the host system.
