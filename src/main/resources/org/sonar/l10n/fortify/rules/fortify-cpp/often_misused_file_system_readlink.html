							<p>
							  The function <code>readlink()</code> does not null terminate its output.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  The function <code>readlink()</code> takes three arguments:<code> linkname, buffer,</code> and <code>buf_sz</code>. The function looks up the name of the file pointed to by the symbolic link <code>linkname</code> and stores the resolved name to the second argument, <code>buffer</code>. The function stores at most <code>buf_sz</code> characters to <code>buffer</code>. This function is unusual in the C library because it makes no effort to null terminate <code>buffer</code>. Instead, it returns the number of characters it has written.<br><br>A typical misuse of <code>readlink()</code> looks like this:<br>  <br><pre><br> char buf[256];<br> len = readlink(lname, buf, sizeof(buf));<br> buf[len] = '\0';<br></pre><br><br>If <code>len</code> is equal to <code>sizeof(buf)</code>, the null terminator will be written one byte past the end of <code>buf</code>.<br><br>A simple (but incorrect) solution to this problem is to try to make <code>buf</code> large enough that it can always hold the result:<br><br><pre><br> char buf[PATH_MAX+1];<br> len = readlink(lname, buf, sizeof(buf));<br> buf[len] = '\0';<br></pre><br><br>But this "fix" incorrectly assumes that <code>PATH_MAX</code> represents the longest possible path for a file in the filesystem. (<code>PATH_MAX</code> only bounds the longest possible relative path that can be passed to the kernel in a single call.) On most Unix and Linux systems, there is no easily-determined maximum length for a file path, and so the off-by-one buffer overflow risk is still present.<br><br>Buffer overflows aside, whenever a single call to <code>readlink()</code> returns the same value that has been passed to its third argument, it is impossible to know whether the name is precisely that many bytes long, or whether <code>readlink()</code> has truncated the name to avoid overrunning the buffer.
