							<p>
							  Transferring program control to an untrusted program or a transaction, or in an untrusted environment can cause an application to execute malicious commands on behalf of an attacker. 
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Process control vulnerabilities take two forms:<br><br>- An attacker can change the name of the program or the code of the transaction being invoked: the attacker explicitly controls what the program name or transaction code is.<br><br>- An attacker can change the environment in which the program or the transaction is invoked: the attacker implicitly controls a communication area made available to the invoked program or the transaction.<br><br>In this case we are primarily concerned with the first scenario, the possibility that an attacker may be able to control the name of the program or the code of the transaction that is invoked. Process control vulnerabilities of this type occur when:<br><br>1. Data enters the application from an untrusted source.<br><br><br><br>2. The data is used as or as part of a string representing a program name or a transaction code that is invoked.<br><br><br><br>3. By executing code from the invoked program or the transaction, the application gives the attacker a privilege or capability that the attacker would not otherwise have.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code excerpt from a privileged system utility reads a value from an HTTP request to determine the code of the transaction to call.<br><br><pre><br>...<br>tid = request->get_form_field( 'tid' ).<br><br>CALL TRANSACTION tid USING bdcdata  MODE 'N'<br>                         MESSAGES INTO messtab.<br>...<br></pre><br><br>This code excerpt allows an attacker to call any transaction and potentially execute arbitrary code with the elevated privilege of the application. Because the program does not validate the value read from the HTTP request, if an attacker can control this value, then they can fool the application into running malicious code and take control of the system.<br>
