							<p>
							  Executing commands that include unvalidated user input can cause an application to execute malicious commands on behalf of an attacker.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Command injection vulnerabilities take two forms:<br><br>- An attacker can change the command that the program executes: the attacker explicitly controls what the command is.<br><br>- An attacker can change the environment in which the command executes: the attacker implicitly controls what the command means.<br><br>In this case we are primarily concerned with the second scenario, the possibility that an attacker may be able to change the meaning of the command by changing an environment variable or by putting a malicious executable early in the search path. Command injection vulnerabilities of this type occur when:<br><br>1. An attacker modifies an application's environment. <br><br>2. The application executes a command without specifying an absolute path or verifying the binary being executed. <br><br>3. By executing the command, the application gives an attacker a privilege or capability that the attacker would not otherwise have. <br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code is from a web application that allows users access to an interface through which they can update their password on the system. Part of the process for updating passwords in this network environment is to run an <code>update.exe</code> command, as shown below. <br><br><pre><br>...<br>Process.Start("update.exe");<br>...<br></pre><br><br>The problem here is that the program does not specify an absolute path and fails to clean its environment prior to executing the call to <code>Process.start()</code>. If an attacker can modify the <code>$PATH</code> variable to point to a malicious binary called <code>update.exe</code> and cause the program to be executed in their environment, then the malicious binary will be loaded instead of the one intended. Because of the nature of the application, it runs with the privileges necessary to perform system operations, which means the attacker's <code>update.exe</code> will now be run with these privileges, possibly giving the attacker complete control of the system.
