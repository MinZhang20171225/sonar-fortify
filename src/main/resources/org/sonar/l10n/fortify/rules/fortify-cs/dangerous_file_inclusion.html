							<p>
							  Allowing unvalidated user input to control files that are included dynamically in a HTML file can lead to malicious code execution.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Many modern web scripting languages enable code re-use and modularization through the ability to include additional source files within one encapsulating file. This ability is often used to apply a standard look and feel to an application (templating), share functions without the need for compiled code, or break the code into smaller more manageable files. Included files are interpreted as part of the parent file and executed in the same manner. File inclusion vulnerabilities occur when the path of the included file is controlled by unvalidated user input.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code takes a user specified template name and includes it in the HTML page to be rendered.<br><br><pre><br>...<br>ClientScript.RegisterClientScriptInclude("RequestParameterScript", HttpContext.Current.Request.Params["includedURL"]);<br>...<br></pre><br><br>In the above example, an attacker can take complete control of the dynamic include statement by supplying a malicious value for <code>includedURL</code> that causes the program to include a file from an external site.<br><br>If the attacker specifies a valid file to a dynamic include statement, .NET will insert the contents of that file into the HTML file sent to the user. In the case of a plain text file, such as <code>web.config</code>, the file might be rendered as part of the HTML output. Worse, if the attacker can specify a path to a remote site controlled by the attacker, then the dynamic include statement will execute arbitrary malicious code supplied by the attacker.
