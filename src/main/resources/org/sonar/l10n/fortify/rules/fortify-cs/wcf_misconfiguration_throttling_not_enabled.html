							<p>
							  Not placing a limit on the use of system resources could result in resource exhaustion and ultimately a denial of service.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) offers the ability to throttle service requests. Allowing too many client requests can flood a system and exhaust its resources. On the other hand, allowing only a small number of requests to a service can prevent legitimate users from using the service. Each service should be individually tuned to and configured to allow the appropriate amount of resources.<br><br>
