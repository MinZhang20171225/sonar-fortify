							<p>
							  Memory is allocated but never freed.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Memory leaks have two common and sometimes overlapping causes:<br><br>- Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.<br><br>- Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for freeing the memory.<br><br>Most memory leaks result in general software reliability problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a memory leak, the attacker might be able to launch a denial of service attack (by crashing the program) or take advantage of other unexpected program behavior resulting from a low memory condition [1].<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following C function leaks a block of allocated memory if the call to <code>read()</code> fails to return the expected number of bytes:<br><br><pre><br>  char* getBlock(int fd) {<br>  char* buf = (char*) malloc(BLOCK_SIZE);<br>  if (!buf) {<br>    return NULL;<br>  }<br>  if (read(fd, buf, BLOCK_SIZE) != BLOCK_SIZE) {<br>    return NULL;<br>  }<br>  return buf;<br>}<br></pre>
