							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The program can potentially fail to release a system resource.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  The program can potentially fail to release a system resource.<br><br>Resource leaks have at least two common causes:<br><br>- Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.<br><br>- Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.<br><br>Most unreleased resource issues result in general software reliability problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a resource leak, the attacker might be able to launch a denial of service by depleting the resource pool.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following function does not close the file handle it opens. If the process is long-lived, it may run out of file handles.<br><br><pre><br>BEGIN<br>...<br>  F1 := UTL_FILE.FOPEN('user_dir','u12345.tmp','R',256);<br>  UTL_FILE.GET_LINE(F1,V1,32767);<br>...<br>END;<br></pre><br>
