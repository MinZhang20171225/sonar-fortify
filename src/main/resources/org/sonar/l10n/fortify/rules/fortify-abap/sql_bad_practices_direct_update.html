							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Direct SQL Updates are in general bad practice and should be avoided. They undermine the integrity and security of the system and should not be allowed.  <br><br><br><br>Direct SQL Updates are also error prone and can cause unexpected system behavior.  Some of the issues to watch out for in SAP include: <br><br>-  Authorization checks are not part of the UPDATE statement and need to be explicitly performed.<br><br>-  SAP Locking mechanism must be invoked when using the UPDATE statement to avoid synchronization issues. <br><br>-  Easy to miss edit checks and audit trails that are automatically generated when using SAP transactions.<br><br>-  Need to ensure all associated tables and modules are updated alongwith the main table.<br> <br>
