							<p>
							  Executing commands without specifying an absolute path could allow an attacker to execute a malicious binary by changing <code>$PATH</code> or other aspects of the program's execution environment.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Command injection vulnerabilities take two forms:<br><br>- An attacker can change the command that the program executes: the attacker explicitly controls what the command is.<br><br>- An attacker can change the environment in which the command executes: the attacker implicitly controls what the command means.<br><br>In this case we are primarily concerned with the second scenario, in which an attacker can change the meaning of the command by changing an environment variable or by inserting a malicious executable early on the search path. Command injection vulnerabilities of this type occur when:<br><br>1. An attacker modifies an application's environment. <br><br>2. The application executes a command without specifying an absolute path or verifying the binary being executed. <br><br><br><br>3. By executing the command, the application gives an attacker a privilege or capability that the attacker would not otherwise have. <br><br><b>Example 1:</b> This example demonstrates what can happen when the attacker can change how a command is interpreted. The code is from a web-based CGI utility that allows users to change their passwords. The password update process under NIS includes running <code>make</code> in the <code>/var/yp</code> directory. Note that since the program updates password records, it has been installed <code>setuid root</code>.<br><br>The program invokes <code>make</code> as follows:<br><br><pre><br>system("cd /var/yp &amp;&amp; make &amp;&gt; /dev/null");<br></pre><br><br>The command in this example is hard-coded, so an attacker cannot control the argument passed to <code>system()</code>. However, since the program does not specify an absolute path for <code>make</code> and does not scrub its environment variables prior to invoking the command, the attacker can modify their <code>$PATH</code> variable to point to a malicious binary named <code>make</code> and execute the CGI script from a shell prompt. And since the program has been installed <code>setuid root</code>, the attacker's version of <code>make</code> now runs with <code>root</code> privileges. <br><br>The environment plays a powerful role in the execution of system commands within programs. Functions like <code>system()</code> and <code>exec()</code> use the environment of the program that calls them, and therefore attackers have a potential opportunity to influence the behavior of these calls.
