							<p>
							  Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Use after free errors occur when a program continues to use a pointer after it has been freed. Like double free errors and memory leaks, use after free errors have two common and sometimes overlapping causes:<br><br>- Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.<br><br>- Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for freeing the memory<br><br>Use after free errors sometimes have no effect and other times cause a program to crash. While it is technically feasible for the freed memory to be re-allocated and for an attacker to use this reallocation to launch a buffer overflow attack, we are unaware of any exploits based on this type of attack.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code illustrates a use after free error:<br><br><pre><br>char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);<br>...<br>if (err) {<br>    abrt = 1;<br>    free(ptr);<br>}<br>...<br>if (abrt) {<br>    logError("operation aborted before commit", ptr);<br>}<br></pre>
