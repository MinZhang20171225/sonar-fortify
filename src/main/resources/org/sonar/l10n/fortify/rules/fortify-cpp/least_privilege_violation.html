							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The elevated privilege level required to perform operations such as <code>chroot()</code> should be dropped immediately after the operation is performed.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  When a program calls a privileged function, such as <code>chroot()</code>, it must first acquire <code>root</code> privilege. As soon as the privileged operation has completed, the program should drop <code>root</code> privilege and return to the privilege level of the invoking user. <br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code calls <code>chroot()</code> to restrict the application to a subset of the filesystem below <code>APP_HOME</code> in order to prevent an attacker from using the program to gain unauthorized access to files located elsewhere. The code then opens a file specified by the user and processes the contents of the file. <br><br><pre><br>...<br>chroot(APP_HOME);<br>chdir("/");<br><br>FILE* data = fopen(argv[1], "r+"); <br>...<br></pre><br><br>Constraining the process inside the application's home directory before opening any files is a valuable security measure. However, the absence of a call to <code>setuid()</code> with some non-zero value means the application is continuing to operate with unnecessary <code>root</code> privileges. Any successful exploit carried out by an attacker against the application can now result in a privilege escalation attack because any malicious operations will be performed with the privileges of the superuser. If the application drops to the privilege level of a non-<code>root</code> user, the potential for damage is substantially reduced.
