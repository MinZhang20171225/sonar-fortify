							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The function is obsolete and cannot guarantee that a pointer is valid or referenced memory is safe to use.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  There are a number of reasons not to use the <code>IsBadXXXPtr()</code> class of functions.  These functions are:<br>1) Not thread safe.<br>2) Often implicated in crashes caused by their probing of invalid memory addresses.<br>3) Erroneously believed to carry out proper error handling during exception conditions.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code uses <code>IsBadWritePtr()</code> in an attempt to prevent bad memory writes. <br><pre><br>if (IsBadWritePtr(ptr, length))<br>{<br>    [handle error]<br>}<br></pre><br><br>Programmers often use these functions intending that they will detect exception cases, but the functions usually cause more problems than they fix.<br>
