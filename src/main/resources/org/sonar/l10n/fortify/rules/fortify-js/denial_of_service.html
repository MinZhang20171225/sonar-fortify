							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  An attacker could cause the program to crash or otherwise become unavailable to legitimate users.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Attackers may be able to deny service to legitimate users by flooding the application with requests, but flooding attacks can often be defused at the network layer. More problematic are bugs that allow an attacker to overload the application using a small number of requests. Such bugs allow the attacker to specify the quantity of system resources their requests will consume or the duration for which they will use them.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following code allows a user to specify the size of the file system to be used. By specifying a large number, an attacker can deplete file system resources.<br><br><pre><br>  var fsync = requestFileSystemSync(0, userInput);<br></pre><br><br><b>Example 2:</b> The following code writes to a file. Because the file may be continuously written and re-written until it is deemed closed by the user agent, disk quota, IO bandwidth, and processes that may require analysing the content of the file are impacted.<br><br><pre><br>function oninit(fs) {<br>  fs.root.getFile('applog.txt', {create: false}, function(fileEntry) {<br>    fileEntry.createWriter(function(fileWriter) {<br>      fileWriter.seek(fileWriter.length);<br>      var bb = new BlobBuilder();<br>      bb.append('Appending to a file');<br>      fileWriter.write(bb.getBlob('text/plain'));<br>    }, errorHandler);<br>  }, errorHandler);<br>}<br><br>window.requestFileSystem(window.TEMPORARY, 1024*1024, oninit, errorHandler);<br></pre>
