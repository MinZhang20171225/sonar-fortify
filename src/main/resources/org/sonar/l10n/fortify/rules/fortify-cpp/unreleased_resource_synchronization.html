							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The program fails to release a lock it holds, which might lead to deadlock.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  The program can potentially fail to release a system resource. <br><br>Resource leaks have at least two common causes:<br><br>- Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.<br><br>- Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.<br><br>Most unreleased resource issues result in general software reliability problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a resource leak, the attacker might be able to launch a denial of service by depleting the resource pool.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following function does destroy the condition variable it allocates if an error occurs. If the process is long-lived, the process can run out of file handles.<br><br><pre><br>int helper(char* fName)<br>{<br>   int status; <br>   ...<br>   pthread_cond_init (&amp;count_threshold_cv, NULL);    <br>   pthread_mutex_init(&amp;count_mutex, NULL);<br><br>   status = perform_operation();<br>   if (status) {<br>      printf("%s", "cannot perform operation");<br>      return OPERATION_FAIL;<br>   } <br>   <br>   pthread_mutex_destroy(&amp;count_mutex);<br>   pthread_cond_destroy(&amp;count_threshold_cv);<br>   <br>   return OPERATION_SUCCESS;<br>}<br></pre>
