							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The function returns an <code>unsigned char</code> cast to an <code>int</code>, but the return value is assigned to a <code>char</code> type.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  When an unsigned character cast to an integer is assign to a signed character, its value might be indistinguishable from <code>EOF</code>.<br>		<br><b>Example 1:</b> The code below reads a character and compares it to <code>EOF</code>. <br><br><pre><br>char c;<br><br>while ( (c = getchar()) != '\n' &amp;&amp; c != EOF ) {<br>  ...<br>}<br></pre><br><br>In this case, the return value from <code>getchar()</code> is cast to a <code>char</code> and compared to <code>EOF</code> (an <code>int</code>). Assuming <code>c</code> is a signed 8-bit value and <code>EOF</code> is a 32-bit signed value, then if <code>getchar()</code> returns a character represented by 0xFF, the value of <code>c</code> will be sign extended to 0xFFFFFFFF in the comparison to <code>EOF</code>. Since <code>EOF</code> is typically defined as -1 (0xFFFFFFFF), the loop will terminate erroneously.
